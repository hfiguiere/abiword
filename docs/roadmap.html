bottom of this list.</li>

<p>AbiWord will be at version 0.9 when it has [substantially] all
of the features we want in our "1.0" release. Accordingly, the list
below represents our current plan for the "1.0" feature set. This
list is still subject to a certain amount of change. However, most
of the features that we want for 1.0, have been done.</p>

<p>Note that our target feature set for version 1.0 is very basic.
<i>"Version 1.0 is the beginning, not the end."</i></p>

<p>After sufficient bug fixing on the 0.9 code base, we'll call it
1.0.0 and consider it to be a maintenance tree. When we're ready to
start adding post-1.0 features, we'll fork a new development tree
for the 1.1/1.2 series releases.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>User feedback from the 1.0 release will be used to determine
priorities for the 1.2 release. The following list is extremely
tentative right now.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We're not quite sure where these features go yet.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>This roadmap changes a lot. More specifically, the status and
plan for the project changes a lot, and this roadmap struggles to
keep up.</li>

<li>Version numbers use a scheme similar to the Linux kernel:
Major.Minor.Patch -- The Major version number indicates the overall
version of the app, with differences distinguishing very
substantial levels of features. The Minor version number indicates
an overall level of features within that Major version. Odd
numbered Minor versions are development releases which are not in
maintenance. A release with an even numbered Minor version
indicates a release which is believed to be stable and which will
be maintained even as development of the next version proceeds in a
separate source code tree.</li>

<li>There will not be a 0.8.0 release.</li>

<li>This is, in some sense, a To-Do list. However, since it does
not include a complete listing of bugs, it should not be regarded
as the only listing of work that needs to be done. The difference
between a bug and a missing feature can be subtle, at times. We
mention a specific bug here under certain circumstances, such as
when we know that we'll want it to be fixed for a certain release.
In general, you should check our <a
href="http://www.abisource.com/bugzilla/">bug database</a> for
additional information. The mention of specific bugs in association
with specific releases is not intended to imply that those are the
only bugs which will get fixed for that release.</li>

<li>In general, this list contains only work which is not yet done.
Once it's done, we remove it from this list. If it's partially
done, we'll remove it and replace it with a reminder of the part
that's not done yet. If you want a summary of what has already been
done, we'd suggest our <a href="http://www.abisource.com/bonsai">
Bonsai</a> or <a
href="http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/">archives
of the mailing list</a>.</li>

<li>If you see an email address specified in parenthesis after any
item, that's the person we believe is working on it, or who has
mentioned an intent to do so. If there's no email address there, we
probably don't know who's doing it. Contributors welcome, AbiWord
is a <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/index.html">
Bazaar</a>.</li>

<li>Please notify the mailing list if you see anything on this list
which is inaccurate or out-of-date.</li>

<li>If you want to work on something, please mention your intent to
do so on the mailing list. This will allow us to avoid clashes and
keep this roadmap up to date. Also, most of the features mentioned
below have had at least some discussion, so there is a history of
assumptions about how each feature should work. We don't have a
full, written spec for the behavior of everything, so if you want
to uncover those assumptions, you'll have to ask. <tt>:-)</tt></li>
