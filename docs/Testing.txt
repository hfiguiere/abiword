Testing AbiWord


Built-in test suite
===================


AbiWord has a built-in testsuite.

It is build as the `AbiTest` plugin. Its code is in
`plugins/testharness/xp`

The test harness (testing framework) source code is in `src/af/tf/xp`
It gets linked to the plugin. The plugin links to libabiword (what it
tests).

It all gets build when you build AbiWord. As of now, it needs to be
installed like any other plugins.

To run it:

    $ abiword --plugin=AbiTest

In case of test failure, `abiword` will return a non-zero code.

Individual tests
----------------

Test are *.t.cpp files. Usually in a t subdirector of what they are
testing. They are built and linked directly into the plugin.

When they are run from the AbiTest harness all the basics are setup.
