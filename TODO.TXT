Things Todo For AbiWord
----------------------------

[NB: Many of these things would make excellent projects for new
developers.] 

Sam: Find all the places where the current spell checker crashes.
This is mostly in ispell, which is significantly more unstable than
the pspell code.  Document them as bugs, and file them in BugZilla.

Sam: Figure out why part of the splash screen displays later than the
rest.  Fix this.  

Sam: Look at all the places in the code where we have non-conditional
#ifdef's (that is, #ifdef 1 or #ifdef 0).  Figure out if we still need
them, and what should be done with them.  If the ifdef isn't
documented, document it.
