<h2><A NAME = "text">
Entering Plain Text</A></h2>
To start a new document, it is necessary to start by launching AbiWord
as was explained previously. AbiWord then presents a blank page on which
we can start to make a document.
<p>Initially it is enoungh to access the text in a rough way without being
concerned with its working, of its appearance (i.e., to carry out the data
entry " with the keyboard "). You type with the keyboard all letters
which make the document and they are automatically inserted into the place
where the cursor is.  This cursor automatically advances position with each
new letter, as a typewriter would. <A NAME = "overwrite">If </A>you have turned
the OVERWRITE function on (by pressing the "Insert" key, then the letters you
type will overwrite any existing ones. Of course, you should use capital
letters and spaces between the words.  <p>To introduce a new paragraph, you
simply press on the " Enter " key. However, the " Enter " key is only used to
introduce a new paragraph and must never be used to introduce a simple new
line. The changing of lines is managed by AbiWord when the text overflows the
right hand margin. It is the guiding principle of any word processor. You can
however add a manual line break by simultaneously pressing on the keys " Shift
"&nbsp; and " Enter " and that does not make a new paragraph. 

<h2><A NAME = "spell">
Spell checking</A></h2>
Sometimes you make typing errors during the data entry. To correct the
mispelt text, use:
<blockquote>* the "Backspace"&nbsp; key (above the " Enter " key) makes
it possible to erase the character located BEFORE the cursor of insertion
I.
<br>* The "Delete "&nbsp; key which makes it possible to erase the character
located AFTER the cursor of insertion I.&nbsp;</blockquote>
If a word or a text is selected, the pressing the key " Backspace " or
" Delete " will erase all the selected text.
<p>When a word is mispelt, AbiWord underlines in red this word indicating
that it does not exist in its dictionary. Here for example is the word
juxtaposition:&nbsp;<img SRC="images/faute1.gif" ALT="Le mot erroné est souligné en rouge." height=16 width=69 align=ABSBOTTOM>
It does the same for all the words that it does not know even if they are
correct.
<p>To correct a word underlined in red, click the right button of the mouse
on the word. A&nbsp; menu then opens containing a certain number of suggestions.
If the correctly spelled word appears among the suggestions,&nbsp; click
above so that the mispelt word is automatically corrected.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/faute2.gif" ALT="Un clic droit de la souris sur le mot erroné fait apparaitre un menu contextuel avec des suggestions." height=103 width=120></center>

<p>If no suggestion is made by AbiWord, then that means that AbiWord did
not find any similar word in its dictionary. It should then be checked
if this word is spelt correctly. If this is the case, there are then two
possibilities:&nbsp;
<ol type="a">
<li>
If the mispelt word is not&nbsp; a regular word in your documents, then
choose to be ignore this word. (click on <i>Ignore all</i>) It will not
be underlined any more but this only applies to the current document.</li>

<li>
If the mispelt word on the contrary is&nbsp; frequently&nbsp; in your documents
(like a proper name for example), you can choose to add this word to the
dictionary of AbiWord. (click on <i>Add</i>)</li>
</ol>
The last option (Change) will change the word as below:
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/spelling.jpg" ALT="Le correcteur orthgraphique d'AbiWord." height=236 width=344></center>

<blockquote>* The <i>Ignore</i> button will not underline any more of the
selected word and will continue the checking.
<br>* The button <i>Ignore</i> <i>All</i> will not stop AbiWord on the
selected word if it finds it in the document.
<br>* The <i>Change</i> button will correct the incorrect word by the selected
suggestion.
<br>* The button <i>Change All</i> will correct all the occurrences of
the word of the current document.
<br>* The <i>Cancel</i> button does not carry out any modification and
will exit from this window.Likewise the Escape key.&nbsp;</blockquote>
To launch the spell checker, there are several options:
<ol type="a">
<li>
Go the "Tools" menu and click on " Spelling... " or</li>

<li>
Right click on the underlined word and then click on the last option (Spelling...)&nbsp;
or</li>

<li>
To use the keyboard short cut, press the F7 key&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<h2><A NAME = "stats">Statistics on the document in progress</A></h2> 
          <p>You can get various statistics on the document in progress,
espicially useful during the drafting of a long document. Abiword can
generate a summary or a report/ratio, and it can be
interesting to have statistics, for example, the number of pages or
words which make up the document in                           progress. To
do so, go to the "Tools" menu and click on "
Word Count".</p>            <p>A window similar to the one shown below
appears:</p>            <p align="center"><img border="0"
src="images/wordcount.jpg" alt="La fenêtre Statistiques." width="206"
height="153"></p>            <p align="left">This
                          window gives various bit of information such as the
number of pages in the document, the word count of the document, the          
                number of characters in the document (with or without space),
the number of paragraphs in the document and finally                          
the number of lines in the document. Click on the "Close" button
to close this window.  </p> 


<h2><A NAME = "zoom">
The zoom function</A></h2>
During the data entry or before printing the document, you can zoom in
on the document (to have an overall picture or&nbsp; to see the enlarged
document). There are two ways to do this:
<blockquote>* Click on the small arrow on the right of the&nbsp; Zoom list
located on the Standard toolbar then select the amount of zoom from the
list.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/zoom.gif" ALT="Zoom" height=101 width=60></center>

<p>* To get a more detailed control of the zoom function, go to the "View"
menu option, and then click on " Zoom ", and the window below appears:
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/zoom.jpg" height=283 width=393></center>

<blockquote>The heading " Preview " displays an outline of the enlarged/shrunken
characters
<p>The heading " Zoom to " has several levels of present zoom:
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">Preset zoom with 75%, 100% and 200%
<p>"Page&nbsp; Width" adjusts the zoom level to the width of the screen
<p>"Whole page " displays all the page on the screen
<p>There is also a function ("Percent ") where you can specify the amount
of zoom by clicking on the small arrows in the box or by directly entering&nbsp;
the zoom factor from the keyboard.&nbsp;</ol>
