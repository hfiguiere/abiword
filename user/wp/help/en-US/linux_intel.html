<h2>
Installing AbiWord on Linux / INTEL</h2>
Welcome to the community of AbiWord users!&nbsp;
<p>AbiWord should install and run properly
on any Linux system with INTEL (or INTEL-COMPATIBLE) processor. AbiWord
has been packaged in several different industry standard distribution formats
to simplify the installation onto your system:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.abisource.com">DEB</a> -- Debian 2.1 (Slink) or later&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a href="">RPM</a> -- RedHat 5.2 or later, SuSE 6.1 or later&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a href="">Slp</a> -- Stampede Linux&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a href="">TAR</a> -- works anywhere&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
A much more detailed version of these instructions is contained in the
<a href="">README</a>.&nbsp;
<br>
<hr>
<h3>
<a NAME="rpm"></a>RPM</h3>
The RPM&nbsp; installation process is very simple.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Download the distribution files (<a
href="http://www.abisuite.com">abisuite-0.7.9-1.i386.rpm</a>,
2.6MB).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Become superuser, and enter the command:&nbsp;</li>

<p><br>rpm - Uvh abisuite-0.7.9-1.i386.rpm
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Or, if you are using KDE, right click
on the rpm file, and select kpackage.</font>
<p><img SRC="kpack1.gif" height=171 width=135>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When kpackage comes up, click on
install.</font>
<p><img SRC="kpack2.gif" height=428 width=608>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you have any unsatisfied dependencies,
then you will have to install&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">those before you can install
Abiword.</font> <br>&nbsp;
<li>
This will install AbiWord and supporting files to <tt>/usr/share/abisuite</tt>.
Symbolic links called <tt>AbiWord</tt> and <tt>abiword</tt> will be placed
in <tt>/usr/bin/X11</tt> but not to the actual executable. Using the -
Uvh option instead of - will take care of replacing the older version
of AbiWord for people who are updating.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
For more information on RPM package dependencies, please see the <a
href="http://www.abisource.com">README</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="deb"></a>DEB</h3>
The DEB  installation process is very simple.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Download the distribution files (<a
href="http://www.abisource.com">abisuite_0.7.9-1_i386.deb</a>,
2.6MB).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Become superuser, enter the command:&nbsp;</li>

<pre>&nbsp; dpkg - I abisuite_0.7.7-1_i386.deb</pre>

<li>
This will install AbiWord and supporting files to <tt>/usr/share/abisuite</tt>.
Symbolic links called <tt>AbiWord</tt> and <tt>abiword</tt> will be placed
in <tt>/usr/bin/X11</tt> but not the actual executable.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
For more information one DEB package dependencies, please see the <a
href="http://www.abisource.com">README</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="slp"></a>SLP</h3>
The SLP installation process would probably have to be as simple as the
DEB or RPM installation, if only we could try it. We currently don't have
the Stampede Linux distribution installed and haven't tested our Stampede
Linux package builds. These files are automatically generated via <a
href="http://www.abisource.com">Alien</a>.&nbsp; <p>If you try the SLP
distribution, we encourage you to send a message to the <a
href="mailto:abiword-dev@abisource.com">AbiWord development mailing list</a>
with an account of your experiments.&nbsp; <ol>
<li>
Download the distribution files (<a
href="http://www.abisource.com">abisuite-0.7.9.slp</a>, 2.3MB).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Install via the Stampede package manager.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
This will install AbiWord and supporting files to <tt>/usr/share/abisuite</tt>.
Symbolic links called <tt>AbiWord</tt> and <tt>abiword</tt> will be placed
in <tt>/usr/bin/X11</tt> but not the actual executable.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
For more information on SLP package dependencies, please see the <a
href="http://www.abisource.com">README</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="tar"></a>TAR</h3>
There are two versions of the Tar files: one is the statically-linked version
and the other is the dynamically-linked version. The dynamic version is
smaller (2.6Mb vs 3.3Mb), our goal is to make use of a number of shared
libraries on your system. If you don't know what this means, select the
static version.&nbsp;
<p>The installation process for the static Tar files looks scary, but it
is actually quite simple.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Download the distribution files (<a
href="http://www.abisource.com">abisuite-0.7.9-Linux_i386_static.tar.gz</a>,
3.3MB).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Copy the files to a directory that you have permission for and open the
files:&nbsp;</li>

<pre>&nbsp; gunzip - c abisuite-0.7.9-Linux_i386_static.tar.gz |
tar xvf -</pre>
... or, if your tar command supports the ' z' flag:&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp; tar xvzf abisuite-0.7.9-Linux_i386_static.tar.gz</pre>
Both these commands will create the directory <tt>abisuite-0.7.9-Linux_i386_static</tt>.&nbsp;
<li>
Change to that directory and become superuser.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Run the install script:&nbsp;</li>

<pre>&nbsp; /install.sh</pre>

<li>
By default, this will install AbiWord and supporting files to the <tt>/usr/local/AbiSuite</tt>
on your hard drive. You will be given the opportunity to change this if
you wish.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
You will also have the option to create links to the executable in a common
<tt>bin</tt>
directory. By default, this is <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Please consult the <a href="">README</a>
file for additional details.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
The installation process for the dynamic Tar files (<a href="">abisuite-0.7.9-Linux_i386_dynamic.tar.gz</a>,
2.6MB) is identical. Simply substitute <tt>_ dynamic</tt> for <tt>_ static</tt>
in steps 1 and 2 above. If you want to read more about which libraries
and versions that the dynamic version uses, please consult the <a href="">README</a>.&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Saving under Linux</font></b>
<p>If you are saving under linux, it is recommended that you save in your
/home directory, unless you dual boot(see below). If you have a lot of
documents you should put them in a directory such as /home/documents.&nbsp;
<p>If you want to save a document remember you must have permission to
write to it. Sometimes you may not be able to save a document because you
do not have write access. In that case, it is suggested that you try to
"Save As" somewhere else.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Dual Booting Windows and Linux</font></b>
<p>If you dual boot Windows and Linux, and you want to use the files under
both systems, you will have to save your files on a FAT or FAT32 partion,or
on a floppy disk, as windows can not access Linux partions, . It is recommended
that you save the files in a directory such as "My Documents". Remember,
under Linux you must have permission to write to that directory. If you
don't, please contact your administator.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Dual Booting Beos and Linux</font></b>
<p>If you dual boot Beos and Linux, then it is recommended that you save
the files on Beos's native filesystem, under the one directory.<b></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>KDE and Abiword</font></b>
<p>After installing Abiword on your machine, you can then set up Abiword
to work with KDE. Right click on yur desktop, and select "New", and then
"Application", as done below.
<p><img SRC="kde1.gif" height=165 width=160>
<p>You should then type in "Abiword" in a box similar to the one below.
<br><img SRC="kde2.gif" height=128 width=358>
<p>After this, type in any comments that you want, and in the executable
box, type in "abiword", all in lower case.&nbsp;
<br>If you want Abiword icons, then you will have to copy them from /usr/share/Abisuite/icons,
to /usr/share/icons, in order to be able to select them. Your finsihed
screen should look like the one below.
<br><img SRC="kde3.gif" height=428 width=408>
<p>Now all you have to do is press the "OK" button and the Abiword icon
will appear on your desktop. If you like, you can put it onto your panel
by just dragging it from the desktop.
