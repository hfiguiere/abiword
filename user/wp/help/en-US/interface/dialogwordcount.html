<h1>Word Count Dialog</h1>
<p>When the word count dialog is opened, it displays the statistics for your document at that point. If it is left open, the statistics can be updated, as described below.</p>

<h2>Auto Update</h2>
<p>If this option is selected, AbiWord keeps track of the number of words in your document as you type, and updates the statistics accordingly.</p>

<h2>Seconds between updates</h2>
<p>This box tells you how often AbiWord will update the number of words if you have selected Auto Update. You may type a number, or use the arrows beside the box to increase or decrease the interval by tenths of a second.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>The document name and path is displayed at the top of the statistics box.</p>
<p>'Words' gives the number of words in the document, where a word is defined as a string of letters or numbers between two spaces or punctuation marks. Thus, "1" is a single word, but "mis-spelled" is two, and "13/4/95" is three.</p>
<p>'Paragraphs' gives the number of paragraphs, as defined by the number of returns you have typed.</p>
<p>The characters entries are exactly what they sound like. Only printable characters are counted.</p>
<p>'Lines' is the number of lines of text in the document. A blank line inserted by typing return counts; blank space inserted between text, such as if the text is double-spaced, is not.</p>
<p>'Pages' is the number of pages that the document will occupy when printed.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>This button is only available if Auto Update is not selected. Pressing the button updates the word count for your document.</p>

<h2>Close</h2>
<p>This button closes the word count dialog.</p>
