			<H2>What's New</H2>
			<P>For a look at what is planned for upcoming versions of Abiword, please look <A HREF="http://www.abisource.com/~sam/docs/roadmap.html">here</A>.</P>
			<DL>
				<DT><B>Version 0.7.11</B></DT>
				<DD><B></B>
				<UL Type="DISC">
					<LI>1. Columm Dialog.<BR>
					Bruce Pearson grabbed one of the few remaining dialogs that still needed to be created; the Columns dialog. Now
					you can adjust columns and column spacing from the dialog rather than messing around with the ruler controls. A
					columms dialog has been done for BEOS, Linux and Windows.
					<LI>2. Zoom. <BR>
					Bruce Pearson (does that name sound familiar?) also finished off the zoom dialog so that now you can zoom to page
					size. This kind of touch-up dialog work really shows how much closer AbiWord is getting to version 1.0.
					<LI>3. Insert Picture.<BR>
					Michael Pritchett added an Insert Picture dialog. This dialog offers a small preview window so that you can see
					what it is you are trying to add. Michael did a thorough job making sure this dialog Just Works, and is another
					example of how the AbiWord development team is paying close attention to user's expectations.
					<LI>4. GoTo. <BR>
					The Goto dialog had suffered a rough beginning, first making its appearance in AbiWod 0.7.9, and then disappearing
					in 0.7.10. Thomas Briggs finished up the work required to make this dialog modeless and got it back into AbiWord
					to stay.
					<LI>5. Automatic exception handling. <BR>
					It's always gratifying to see AbiWord get a useful feature that no other word processor has. Sam TH added support
					for automatic exception handling. This means that should AbiWord crash for some unknown reason, the document you
					are working on will be saved right then and there. Of course, everyone hopes Sam's feature will never be used,
					but he will be held in high regard when it does. This feature is for UNIX systems only.
					<LI>6. Major BeOS progress. <BR>
					Christopher Plymire added so many updates to the BeOS build, there is no way I could list them here. He added all
					missing dialogs relative to the Windows and Linux ports and fixed most of the major bugs. With all of Christopher's
					work, plus some help from Ithamar Adema, AbiWord for BeOS is now ready for prime time.
					<LI>7. Better help.<BR>
					David Schmitter added a help menu that now directly references the main help files. Add to that edits to the help
					files themselves by Karl Ove Hufthammer and Ashleigh Gordon, and you have an integrated help system beginning to
					take shape.
					<LI>8. Alternate font handling. <BR>
					There are lots of features a good word processor has that most people only notice when they are missing. One of
					these is proper handling of alternate fonts such as symbols and dingbats. Bill Carpenter did a great job tracking
					down many of these problems, such as import of smart quotes from RTF and MSWord documents, and making sure the
					spell checker didn't get caught on them.
					<LI>9. Bug fixes.<BR>
					There was a quite a bit of bug fixing going on behind the scenes. In many cases, these were issues we didn't even
					realize were there until the fix came in! An all-inclusive list would be too long, but some of the highlights are
					#910: paragraph control now work more intuitively (Bruce Perason), #919: Change button in Spell dialog now works
					correctly (Thomas Briggs), #935: What was this bug? (Big Ed), #944: keyboard shortcuts added for default styles.
					(Karl Hufthammer) Improved Find/Replace algorithm: (Allan Clark and Anders Melchiorsen), Dragging ruler marks now
					forces pages to autoscroll and printing accenterd characters on UNIX: (Aaron Lehman), Soft hyphen are now supported:
					(Martin Vermeer), Headers are now centered in HTML export (Joseph Kelsey)
					<LI>10. Translations. <BR>
					Tim Allen reworked the Field and Goto dialogs so that the text within the dialog could also be translated. These
					and other additions led to the following translation updates: Finnish (Jarmo Karvonen), German (Harald Fernengel),
					Italian (Marco Innocentri), Norwegian Nynorsk translations (Karl Ove Hufthammer), Norwegian BOK translations (Karl
					Kalleberg), Polish (Eutanazy Sercxemulo), Portuguese (Rob Silva), Spanish (Joaquin Cuenca) and Swedish (Henrik
					Berg). Also, Owen Thomas added a Welch translation.
					<LI>11. Import/Export. <BR>
					Michael Pritchitt added support for BMP import. Most Windows users have these all over their system; now you can
					put them into your AbiWord documents. On a totally different front, David Nay added support for PalmDoc export.
					Now you can save AbiWord documents and have them in the Palm of your hand.
					<LI>12. GNOME. <BR>
					Dom Lachowicz also added GNOME-afied the print dialog. Joaquin also added a Show/Hide status bar button.
					<LI>13. Ports. <BR>
					Thomas Fletcher still continues to make major headway on the QNX port. As of AbiWord 0.7.11, AbiWord for QNX is
					on par feature for feature with Windows and Linux. In other porting news, Hubert Figurer started a MacOS X port
					of AbiWord. This is aimed to help the MacOS port go forward as the MacOS X port requires less work that a rough
					MacOS port while still solving some of the eventual problems.
				</UL>
				<DT><B>Version 0.7.10</B></DT>
				<DD><B></B>
				<UL Type="DISC">
					<LI>1. GNOME builds.<BR>
					Due to extensive work by Joaqu&iacute;n Cuenca Abela and many others, AbiWord now utilizes the GNOME front end.
					This is not so much an individual feature or effort, but a cumulative one. GNOME binaries are now available in
					RPM format for Intel architectures.
					<LI>2. Editing Improvements.<BR>
					Bruce Pearson fixed some of the more visible editing problems AbiWord previously had. For example, now when you
					erase all characters in a paragraph, the font size and format do not reset to the default. This problem manifested
					itself in a number of ways, such as incorrect line spacing on blank paragraphs when the font size was changed,
					and many other small annoyances General editing around font size and format boundaries makes much more sense now.
					Also, Jesper Skov provided more intelligent cursor motion at line boundaries.
					<LI>3. Show Paragraphs.<BR>
					Alexey Sintutin added the basic framework for this feature which allows invisible characters such as tabs, page
					breaks and section breaks to be visible. Hard paragraph breaks are not yet shown, but the current implementation
					of Show Paragraphs goes a long way.
					<LI>4. Modeless dialogs.<BR>
					Martin Sevior extended his work on the Insert Symbol dialog by making it modeless. To do so, he had to implement
					an entire modeless dialog framework. This work paves the way for other contributors to make other dialogs modeless
					as well. Everyone who enjoys leaving dialogs active while doing other actions applauds this effort.
					<LI>5. Word count dialog. <BR>
					This addition has been simmering for some time. Sam Tobin-Hochstatd created the dialog, and it is now available
					in the UNIX builds. Traditionally, AbiWord development proceeds with a dialog appearing on one OS first, then it
					is quickly ported to all other operating systems, so Windows users should see this dialog added shortly.
					<LI>6. GoTo dialog. <BR>
					Joaqu&iacute;n Cuenca Abela was busy this month. This dialog also makes its appearance on UNIX, and should also
					appear on Windows soon. Now you can GoTo a specific line or page on the fly.
					<LI>7. Help. <BR>
					AbiWord now has on-line help. These help files are included in the distribution courtesy of Christophe Caron (ChrisDigo@aol.com)
					Currently, help is available in French and English. This feature is a great testimony of how individuals can make
					a real difference in an Open Source project. The English translation of the files are still a little rough around
					the edges, but these will continue to improve as we have toward AbiWord 1.0.
					<LI>8. RTF Improvements. <BR>
					Hubert Figuiere fixed a number of RTF related issues. For example, now optional hyphens import correctly (#837),
					RTF export no longer produces extra spaces after accented characters (#569), and AbiWord now correctly imports
					accented characters in RTF files created by TED (#886).
					<LI>9. Ruler fixes.<BR>
					Previously, there were a number of ways to cause problems in AbiWord by moving page and paragraph margins in the
					ruler in ways they were not supposed to be moved. A tag team effort of Alexey Sintutin (megabyte@salesexplosion.com)
					and Aaron Lehmann (aaronl@vitelus.com) has done a thorough job of eliminating almost all possible cases.
					<LI>10. Many Bug fixes. <BR>
					Better error checking for command line arguments was added by Sam Tobin-Hochstatd (#250). Windows and Linux printouts
					now have identical margins, courtesy of Mike Nordell (#274). Better handling of images in multi-column documents
					from Aaron Lehmann. The X11-multi key no longer causes problems courtesy of HJ (#435). Matt Kraai made sure that
					changing justification no longer causes tabs to get lost (#443). Martin Sevior also took time out to fix a crashing
					bug relating to zooming and selections (#596). Postscript output now handles colored text when LC_NUMERIC is set
					thanks to Kenny MacDonald (#604). Postscript page numbers now work correctly due to Hubert Figuiere (#843).. Cut
					and Paste with gnome terminals now works thanks to Petr Tesarik. The LaTeX exporter now exports line height, left
					and the right margins, and justification thanks to Joaqu&iacute;n Cuenca Abela. Finally, Mike Meyer added some
					code to make the AbiWord font reader on UNIX more robust.
					<LI>11. Code cleanup. <BR>
					Mike Nordell swept through the AbiWord code base like a whirlwind, fixing all sorts of little code oddities. It
					is likely that this a fixed a number of problems never before identified.
					<LI>12. Development environment improvements.<BR>
					Michael D. Pritchett (MPritchett@attglobal.net) figured out how to work around the new Cygnus tools while Jesper
					Skov added some internal functions to make it easier for AbiWord developers to peer into AbiWord's internal structures.
					Also, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer fixes some issues with newer versions of GCC. All of these changes mean it will be
					easier for even more contributors to join the AbiSource project.
					<LI>13. Translations.<BR>
					A Galician translation was added by Jesus Bravo Alvarez (jba@pobox.com) The following translations have been updated:
					Danish (Birger Langkjer and Martin Hansen), German (Harald Fernengel), Spanish (Joaqu&iacute;n Cuenca Abela), and
					Swedish (Linus G Larsson)
