<h2>What's New</h2>
<p>For a look at what is planned for upcoming versions of Abiword, please look <a href="http://www.abisource.com/~sam/docs/roadmap.html">here</a>.</p>

<dl>
 	
 	  <dt><b>Version 0.7.11</b>
	 <dd>
 <ul type=disc>
<li> 1.  Columm Dialog.<BR>
Bruce Pearson grabbed one of the few remaining dialogs that still needed to be created;
the Columns dialog. Now you can adjust columns and column spacing from the dialog rather
than messing around with the ruler controls. A columms dialog has been done for BEOS,
Linux and Windows. <BR>

<li>2. Zoom. <BR>
Bruce Pearson (does that name sound familiar?) also finished off the zoom dialog so that
now you can zoom to page size. This kind of touch-up dialog work really shows how much
closer AbiWord is getting to version 1.0. <BR>

<li>3. Insert Picture.<BR>
Michael Pritchett added an Insert Picture dialog. This dialog offers a small preview
window so that you can see what it is you are trying to add. Michael did a thorough job
making sure this dialog Just Works, and is another example of how the AbiWord
development team is paying close attention to user's expectations. <BR>

<li>4. GoTo. <BR>
The Goto dialog had suffered a rough beginning, first making its appearance in AbiWod
0.7.9, and then disappearing in 0.7.10. Thomas Briggs finished up the work required to
make this dialog modeless and got it back into AbiWord to stay. <BR>

<li>5. Automatic exception handling. <BR>
It's always gratifying to see AbiWord get a useful feature that no other word processor
has. Sam TH added support for automatic exception handling. This means that should
AbiWord crash for some unknown reason, the document you are working on will be saved
right then and there. Of course, everyone hopes Sam's feature will never be used, but
he will be held in high regard when it does. This feature is for UNIX systems only. <BR>


<li>6. Major BeOS progress. <BR>
Christopher Plymire added so many updates to the BeOS build, there is no way I could
list them here. He added all missing dialogs relative to the Windows and Linux ports
and fixed most of the major bugs. With all of Christopher's work, plus some help from
Ithamar Adema, AbiWord for BeOS is now ready for prime time. <BR>


<li>7. Better help.<BR>
David Schmitter added a help menu that now directly references the main help files. Add
to that edits to the help files themselves by Karl Ove Hufthammer and Ashleigh Gordon,
and you have an integrated help system beginning to take shape. <BR>


<li>8. Alternate font handling. <BR>
There are lots of features a good word processor has that most people only notice when
they are missing. One of these is proper handling of alternate fonts such as symbols
and dingbats. Bill Carpenter did a great job tracking down many of these problems, such
as import of smart quotes from RTF and MSWord documents, and making sure the spell
checker didn't get caught on them. <BR>


<li>9. Bug fixes.<BR>
There was a quite a bit of bug fixing going on behind the scenes. In many cases, these
were issues we didn't even realize were there until the fix came in! An all-inclusive
list would be too long, but some of the highlights are #910: paragraph control now work
more intuitively (Bruce Perason), #919: Change button in Spell dialog now works
correctly (Thomas Briggs), #935: Another cursor dirt fix (Big Ed), #944: keyboard
shortcuts added for default styles. (Karl Hufthammer) Improved Find/Replace algorithm:
(Allan Clark and Anders Melchiorsen), Dragging ruler marks now forces pages to
autoscroll and printing accenterd characters on UNIX: (Aaron Lehman), Soft hyphen are
now supported: (Martin Vermeer), Headers are now centered in HTML export (Joseph Kelsey) <BR>


<li>10. Translations. <BR>
Tim Allen reworked the Field and Goto dialogs so that the text within the dialog could
also be translated. These and other additions led to the following translation updates:
Finnish (Jarmo Karvonen), German (Harald Fernengel), Italian (Marco Innocentri),
Norwegian Nynorsk translations (Karl Hufthammer), Norwegian BOK translations (Karl
Kalleberg), Polish (Eutanazy Sercxemulo), Portuguese (Rob Silva), Spanish (Joaquin
Cuenca) and Swedish (Henrik Berg). Also, Owen Thomas added a Welch translation. <BR>


<li>11. Import/Export. <BR>
Michael Pritchitt added support for BMP import. Most Windows users have these all over
their system; now you can put them into your AbiWord documents. On a totally different
front, David Nay added support for PalmDoc export. Now you can save AbiWord documents
and have them in the Palm of your hand. <BR>

<li>12. GNOME. <BR>
Dom Lachowicz also added GNOME-afied the print dialog. Joaquin also added a Show/Hide
status bar button. <BR>

<li>13. Ports. <BR>
Thomas Fletcher still continues to make major headway on the QNX port. As of AbiWord
0.7.11, AbiWord for QNX is on par feature for feature with Windows and Linux. In other
porting news, Hubert Figurer started a MacOS X port of AbiWord. This is aimed to help
the MacOS port go forward as the MacOS X port requires less work that a rough MacOS
port while still solving some of the eventual problems. <BR>


</ul>
 	
 	 <dt><b>Version 0.7.10</b>
	 <dd>
 <ul type=disc>
        <li> 1.  GNOME builds.<BR>  Due to extensive work by Joaquín Cuenca Abela and many
others, AbiWord now utilizes the GNOME front end.  This is not so much an
individual feature or effort, but a cumulative one.  GNOME binaries are now
available in RPM format for Intel architectures.      <BR>

<li>2.  Editing Improvements.<BR>  Bruce Pearson fixed some of the more visible
editing problems AbiWord previously had.  For example, now when you erase
all characters in a paragraph, the font size and format do not reset to the
default.  This problem manifested itself in a number of ways, such as
incorrect line spacing on blank paragraphs when the font size was changed,
and many other small annoyances  General editing around font size and
format boundaries makes much more sense now.  Also, Jesper Skov provided
more intelligent cursor motion at line boundaries.     <BR>

<li>3.  Show Paragraphs.<BR>  Alexey Sintutin added the basic framework for this
feature which allows invisible characters such as tabs, page breaks and
section breaks to be visible.  Hard paragraph breaks are not yet shown, but
the current implementation of Show Paragraphs goes a long way.  <BR>

<li>4.  Modeless dialogs.<BR>  Martin Sevior extended his work on the Insert Symbol
dialog by making it modeless.  To do so, he had to implement an entire
modeless dialog framework.  This work paves the way for other contributors
to make other dialogs modeless as well.  Everyone who enjoys leaving
dialogs active while doing other actions applauds this effort.    <BR>

<li>5.  Word count dialog. <BR> This addition has been simmering for some
time.  Sam Tobin-Hochstatd created the dialog, and it is now available in
the UNIX builds.  Traditionally, AbiWord development proceeds with a dialog
appearing on one OS first, then it is quickly ported to all other operating
systems, so Windows users should see this dialog added shortly.    <BR>

<li>6.  GoTo dialog. <BR> Joaquín Cuenca Abela was busy this month.  This dialog
also makes its appearance on UNIX, and should also appear on Windows
soon.  Now you can GoTo a specific line or page on the fly.      <BR>

<li>7.  Help. <BR> AbiWord now has on-line help.  These help files are included in
the distribution courtesy of Christophe Caron
(ChrisDigo@aol.com)  Currently, help is available in French and
English.  This feature is a great testimony of how individuals can make a
real difference in an Open Source project.  The English translation of the
files are still a little rough around the edges, but these will continue to
improve as we have toward AbiWord 1.0.               <BR>

<li>8.  RTF Improvements. <BR> Hubert Figuiere fixed a number of RTF related
issues.  For example, now optional hyphens import correctly (#837), RTF
export no longer produces extra spaces after accented characters (#569),
and AbiWord now correctly imports accented characters in RTF files created
by TED (#886).         <BR>

<li>9. Ruler fixes.<BR>  Previously, there were a number of ways to cause problems
in AbiWord by moving page and paragraph margins in the ruler in ways they
were not supposed to be moved.  A tag team effort of Alexey Sintutin
(megabyte@salesexplosion.com) and Aaron Lehmann (aaronl@vitelus.com) has
done a thorough job of eliminating almost all possible cases. <BR>

<li>10.  Many Bug fixes. <BR>  Better error checking for command line arguments
was added by Sam Tobin-Hochstatd (#250). Windows and Linux printouts now
have identical margins, courtesy of Mike Nordell (#274).  Better handling
of images in multi-column documents from Aaron Lehmann.  The X11-multi key
no longer causes problems courtesy of  HJ (#435).  Matt Kraai made sure
that changing justification no longer causes tabs to get lost
(#443).  Martin Sevior also took time out to fix a crashing bug relating to
zooming and selections (#596).  Postscript output now handles colored text
when LC_NUMERIC is set thanks to Kenny MacDonald (#604).  Postscript page
numbers now work correctly due to Hubert Figuiere (#843).. Cut and Paste
with gnome terminals now works thanks to Petr Tesarik. The LaTeX exporter
now exports line height, left and the right margins, and justification
thanks to Joaquín Cuenca Abela. Finally, Mike Meyer added some code to make
the AbiWord font reader on UNIX more robust.  <BR>

<li>11.  Code cleanup. <BR> Mike Nordell swept through the AbiWord code base like a
whirlwind, fixing all sorts of little code oddities.  It is likely that
this a fixed a number of problems never before identified.     <BR>

<li>12.  Development environment improvements.<BR>  Michael D. Pritchett
(MPritchett@attglobal.net)
figured out how to work around the new Cygnus tools while Jesper Skov added
some internal functions to make it easier for AbiWord developers to peer
into AbiWord's internal structures. Also, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer fixes some
issues with newer versions of GCC.  All of these changes mean it will be
easier for even more contributors to join the AbiSource project.     <BR>

<li>13.  Translations.<BR>  A Galician translation was added by Jesus Bravo Alvarez
(jba@pobox.com)
The following translations have been updated: Danish (Birger Langkjer and
Martin Hansen),  German (Harald Fernengel), Spanish (Joaquín Cuenca Abela),
and Swedish (Linus G Larsson)</ul>
