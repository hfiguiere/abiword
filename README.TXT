This tree contains the following top-level subdirectories:

src
	All source code is under here, including applications,
	library modules, and third-party source code.

docs
	Documents related to the project.  Includes specifications,
	design documents, and the like.  You should also find instructions
	for how to build the tree in here as well.

dist
	This is where things are placed after they are built.  Under this
	directory, you'll find one or more directories which are named
	in accordance with the platform on which the build took place.
	The dist directory is initially absent, since nothing is placed
	there until it has been built.

shots
	Screen shots for each product. 


test
	Test files for each product. 

user
	Support files, other than code, which need to be installed
	on the user's machine, are stored in here.  Items which
	are too large to be practical do not necessarily go here,
	such as the fonts.
