/*****************************************************************
** The file-open and file-save-as dialogs have
** app-persistence, but the persistence is
** independent of each other.  This code supports
** both dialogs; one instance of this object will
** be created for each.  The object, once created,
** will be recycled (reused) throughout the session.
**
** We observe the following basic policy:
** [] we are to be given the pathname of the document
**    in the frame from which we were requested.  if
**    it is 'untitled', give us a null pathname.
** [] if the document has a pathname, we will start
**    the dialog in directory(pathname).
** [] if the document does not have a pathname, we
**    will start in the directory we were in when
**    last OK'd.  (we ignore previous CANCEL's.)
** [] if the document does not have a pathname and
**    we have no previous OK'd use, we start the
**    dialog in the current directory (probably from
**    where the application was invoked from).
** [] we do not let the current working directory
**    change.
