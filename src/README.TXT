The 'src' directory contains all source code for all modules and applications
in the tree.  This directory contains the following subdirectories:

other
	This is where source code for all third-party libraries is placed.
	For example, we use James Clark's XML parser, expat, which is
	stored here.  In general, don't put libraries in 'other' if
	we are making substantial modifications to the code.  Minor bug
	fixes are fine (please send the fix back to the original author).
	Customizations to make the library fit into our build system are
	fine.  Source code in 'other' is not required to comply with
	every one of our coding guidelines.  Don't make gratuitous sweeping
	changes just to fix the indent level on someone else's library.

wp
	Source code for the word processor application.

util
	Source code for general-purpose utility functions.

config
	Files related to the build system.  This contains no actual
	product source code.  Rather, it contains things like
	Makefiles and scripts.

dist
	This is where things are placed after they are built.  Under this
	directory, you'll find one or more directories which are named
	in accordance with the platform on which the build took place.
	The dist directory is initially empty, since nothing is placed
	there until it has been built.

ps
	Source code for PostScript generation.  Currently used only by
	AbiWord, but will likely be used by other products later.

Subdirectories below may have additional hierarchy to further break
things down by module.  However, eventually, source code should find
itself in a directory which indicates the portability of the code
within it.  For example, cross-platform code should always be placed
in a subdirectory called 'xp'.  Win32-specific code should be in a
subdirectory called 'win32'.
