 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.5  2007/01/20 18:30:16  sum1
 * g_free -> free.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2007/01/16 23:13:55  dom
 * that was embarrassing. g_free software? :) also, handle strdup()
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2007/01/16 21:45:42  dom
 * bug 10751 - use glib's types and memory allocation functions. no more mismatched g_free/g_free g_try_malloc/g_malloc
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/01/29 05:50:11  hippietrail
 *
 * Fixed my mess in EncodingManager.
 * Changed many C casts to C++ casts.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/24 05:52:33  hippietrail
 *
 * Refactored ispell code. Old ispell global variables had been put into
 * an allocated structure, a pointer to which was passed to many functions.
 * I have now made all such functions and variables private members of the
 * ISpellChecker class. It was C OO, now it's C++ OO.
 *
 * I've fixed the makefiles and tested compilation but am unable to test
 * operation. Please back out my changes if they cause problems which
 * are not obvious or easy to fix.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/09/19 05:31:15  hippietrail
 *
 * More Ispell cleanup.  Conditional globals and DEREF macros are removed.
 * K&R function declarations removed, converted to Doxygen style comments
 * where possible.  No code has been changed (I hope).  Compiles for me but
 * unable to test.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/09/17 03:03:29  hippietrail
 *
 * After seeking permission on the developer list I've reformatted all the
 * spelling source which seemed to have parts which used 2, 3, 4, and 8
 * spaces for tabs.  It should all look good with our standard 4-space
 * tabs now.
 * I've concentrated just on indentation in the actual code.  More prettying
 * could be done.
 * * NO code changes were made *
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/09/13 17:20:13  mpritchett
 * Fix more warnings for Linux build
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/05/12 16:05:42  thomasf
 * Big pseudo changes to ispell to make it pass around a structure rather
 * than rely on all sorts of gloabals willy nilly here and there.  Also
 * fixed our spelling class to work with accepting suggestions once more.
 * This code is dirty, gross and ugly (not to mention still not supporting
 * multiple hash sized just yet) but it works on my machine and will no
 * doubt break other machines.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/04/15 16:01:24  tomas_f
 * moving to spell/xp
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1998/12/29 14:55:33  eric
 *
 * I've doctored the ispell code pretty extensively here.  It is now
 * warning-free on Win32.  It also *works* on Win32 now, since I
 * replaced all the I/O calls with ANSI standard ones.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1998/12/28 23:11:30  eric
 *
 * modified spell code and integration to build on Windows.
 * This is still a hack.
 *
 * Actually, it doesn't yet WORK on Windows.  It just builds.
 * SpellCheckInit is failing for some reason.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1998/12/28 18:04:43  davet
 * Spell checker code stripped from ispell.  At this point, there are
 * two external routines...  the Init routine, and a check-a-word routine
 * which returns a boolean value, and takes a 16 bit char string.
 * The code resembles the ispell code as much as possible still.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  1994/01/25  07:11:34  geoff
 * Get rid of all old RCS log lines in preparation for the 3.1 release.
