 * Revision 1.5  2007/01/19 16:56:51  sum1
 * g_free -> free.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2007/01/16 23:13:55  dom
 * that was embarrassing. g_free software? :) also, handle strdup()
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2007/01/16 21:45:42  dom
 * bug 10751 - use glib's types and memory allocation functions. no more mismatched g_free/g_free g_try_malloc/g_malloc
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/01/29 05:50:11  hippietrail
 *
 * Fixed my mess in EncodingManager.
 * Changed many C casts to C++ casts.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/24 05:52:32  hippietrail
 *
 * Refactored ispell code. Old ispell global variables had been put into
 * an allocated structure, a pointer to which was passed to many functions.
 * I have now made all such functions and variables private members of the
 * ISpellChecker class. It was C OO, now it's C++ OO.
 *
 * I've fixed the makefiles and tested compilation but am unable to test
 * operation. Please back out my changes if they cause problems which
 * are not obvious or easy to fix.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/01/06 18:48:38  dom
 * ispell cleanup, start of using new 'add' save features
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/09/19 05:31:15  hippietrail
 *
 * More Ispell cleanup.  Conditional globals and DEREF macros are removed.
 * K&R function declarations removed, converted to Doxygen style comments
 * where possible.  No code has been changed (I hope).  Compiles for me but
 * unable to test.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/09/17 03:03:29  hippietrail
 *
 * After seeking permission on the developer list I've reformatted all the
 * spelling source which seemed to have parts which used 2, 3, 4, and 8
 * spaces for tabs.  It should all look good with our standard 4-space
 * tabs now.
 * I've concentrated just on indentation in the actual code.  More prettying
 * could be done.
 * * NO code changes were made *
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/09/13 17:20:12  mpritchett
 * Fix more warnings for Linux build
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/05/12 16:05:42  thomasf
 * Big pseudo changes to ispell to make it pass around a structure rather
 * than rely on all sorts of gloabals willy nilly here and there.  Also
 * fixed our spelling class to work with accepting suggestions once more.
 * This code is dirty, gross and ugly (not to mention still not supporting
 * multiple hash sized just yet) but it works on my machine and will no
 * doubt break other machines.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/04/15 16:01:24  tomas_f
 * moving to spell/xp
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2000/02/09 22:35:25  sterwill
 * Clean up some warnings
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1998/12/29 14:55:32  eric
 *
 * I've doctored the ispell code pretty extensively here.  It is now
 * warning-free on Win32.  It also *works* on Win32 now, since I
 * replaced all the I/O calls with ANSI standard ones.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1998/12/28 23:11:30  eric
 *
 * modified spell code and integration to build on Windows.
 * This is still a hack.
 *
 * Actually, it doesn't yet WORK on Windows.  It just builds.
 * SpellCheckInit is failing for some reason.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1998/12/28 22:16:22  eric
 *
 * These changes begin to incorporate the spell checker into AbiWord.  Most
 * of this is a hack.
 *
 * 1.  added other/spell to the -I list in config/abi_defs
 * 2.  replaced other/spell/Makefile with one which is more like
 * 	our build system.
 * 3.  added other/spell to other/Makefile so that the build will now
 * 	dive down and build the spell check library.
 * 4.  added the AbiSpell library to the Makefiles in wp/main
 * 5.  added a call to SpellCheckInit in wp/main/unix/UnixMain.cpp.
 * 	This call is a HACK and should be replaced with something
 * 	proper later.
 * 6.  added code to fv_View.cpp as follows:
 * 	whenever you double-click on a word, the spell checker
 * 	verifies that word and prints its status to stdout.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * 1.  This will break the Windows build.  I'm going to work on fixing it
 * 	now.
 * 2.  This only works if your dictionary is in /usr/lib/ispell/american.hash.
 * 	The dictionary location is currently hard-coded.  This will be
 * 	fixed as well.
 *
 * Anyway, such as it is, it works.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1998/12/28 18:04:43  davet
 * Spell checker code stripped from ispell.  At this point, there are
 * two external routines...  the Init routine, and a check-a-word routine
 * which returns a boolean value, and takes a 16 bit char string.
 * The code resembles the ispell code as much as possible still.
 *
 * Revision 1.43  1994/11/02  06:56:05  geoff
 * Remove the anyword feature, which I've decided is a bad idea.
 *
 * Revision 1.42  1994/10/25  05:45:59  geoff
 * Add support for an affix that will work with any word, even if there's
 * no explicit flag.
 *
 * Revision 1.41  1994/05/24  06:23:06  geoff
 * Let tgood decide capitalization questions, rather than doing it ourselves.
 *
 * Revision 1.40  1994/05/17  06:44:10  geoff
 * Add support for controlled compound formation and the COMPOUNDONLY
 * option to affix flags.
 *
 * Revision 1.39  1994/01/25  07:11:31  geoff
 * Get rid of all old RCS log lines in preparation for the 3.1 release.
 *
