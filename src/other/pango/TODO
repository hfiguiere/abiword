[ All the important TODO items have been moved to TODO.xml. These
  are the remaining things where I'm not really sure what I was
  thinking about or not sure that it still is a good idea ]

Engines
=======

* Switch engines to be indentified by properties, instead
  of hardcoded role/language. (?)

Language Modules
================

 * Once we have a libart renderer, porting Raph's devanagari shaper
   to Pango and C (from Perl) would be a cool demo and test case.
  
 * The clusters set by the current modules need to be set.

General
=======

* In some places, we iterate assuming NULL termination through
  strings that might not be NULL terminated. (pango_itemize()?)

* PangoAttrList currently takes the policy of "most recent wins"
  when multiple attributes of the same type are present for a range. 
  It would map better on the TkText tag-based API if attributes
  also had a depth/priority and "most recent wins" only applied
  for attributes of the same priority. 

* Allow UTF8 strings with embedded NULLs.

* pango_font_get_metrics() currently takes a language tag, but
  really uses that to find out one or more _scripts_; should we
  define script tags and put those (optionally?) in the 
  interface?
