// Note: if the tooltip is blank, the status message will be used as the
// Note: tooltip.  therefore, we probably don't need most tooltip strings
// Note: here -- unless the status message is too long to look good in
// Note: a tooltip.

// Note: the icon field should not be localized unless absolutely necessary.
// Note: the icon name here is to a specific icon (pixmap or bitmap or whatever)
// Note: that will always be in the application.  if, for example, a big fat 'B'
// Note: for BOLD doesn't make sense in another language, change the entry in
// Note: the localization and add the icon to whatever table.

// Note: if a tool item does not use an icon (like a combo box), use the
// Note: constant "NoIcon" in that column.
