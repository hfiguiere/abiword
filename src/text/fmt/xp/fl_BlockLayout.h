/*
	A BlockLayout is the object which is responsible for keeping track of 
	the layout information for a given block-level element, aka paragraph.
	This corresponds to CSS' notion of a "block box".  However, we don't
	call it a box, since it is not guaranteed, or even likely, to be
	rectangular.

	This object keeps track of all the CSS block properties which were 
	specified for this paragraph.

	Since a paragraph may be split across 2 or more pages, a fl_BlockLayout 
	may be split into slices.  Each slice is represented by an instance of 
	fp_BlockSlice, declared below.

	The fl_BlockLayout is responsible for managing margins, borders, padding, 
	background colors, first-line-indent, tabs, widow/orphan control and other 
	paragraph-level settings regarding the block element which is contained 
	within it.

	The fl_BlockLayout's primary function is managing the space required for 
	the layout of its paragraph.  It accomplishes this by acting as a proxy 
	for space requests from the fb_LineBreaker.  When the fb_LineBreaker asks 
	for space, using requestLineSpace, the fl_BlockLayout tries (if necessary) 
	to grow one of its BlockSlices enough to accomodate the line.  This 
	involves requesting room to grow from the fp_Column which contains the 
	slice.

	requestLineSpace is called by the fb_LineBreaker to ask the fl_BlockLayout 
	for space which will be filled with a fp_Line.  The iHeight argument 
	specifies how much height we need.  The return value is the maximum width 
	available for a line of the given height.  The underlying state is not 
	modified.  No space is actually reserved until the fp_Line is actually 
	added.

	Usually, the way to use this within a fb_LineBreaker is to guess the 
	height of the line by checking the height of the default font.  Then, ask 
	the fl_BlockLayout for the width of a line that high.  Go ahead and format 
	the line as if it were that wide.  After you're done, check to see if the 
	height of the resulting line is the same as (or smaller than, I suppose) 
	what you guessed.  If it's larger, you need to call requestLineSpace() to 
	make sure that the taller line is still okay at the width.  If not, you 
	have a problem.  If so, go ahead and add the line.  Don't add a line until 
	you know that it fits, or else addLine() will fail in a non-user-friendly 
	way.

	requestLineSpace works by finding the bottom of the last child fp_Line.
	Then, it tries to find space for a rectangle of the given height, 
	immediately below that last fp_Line.

	If the return value is 0, then there is no room for a line of that height.
