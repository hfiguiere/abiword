/*
	FL_DocLayout is a formatted representation of a specific DG_Document, 
	formatted for a specific DG_Graphics context.  

	A FL_DocLayout encapsulates two related hierarchies of objects.  

	The "logical" hierarchy corresponds to the logical structure of the 
	document, and consists of a list of FL_SectionLayout objects, which are 
	in turn composed of FL_BlockLayout objects. 

	The "physical" hierarchy, by contrast, encapsulates the subdivision 
	of physical space into objects of successively finer granularity.  Thus, 
	a FL_DocLayout is also a list of Pages, each of which was constructed 
	during the process of formatting the document.  In turn, 
	
		each FP_Page is a list of SectionSlices.  
		Each FP_SectionSlice is a list of Columns.  
		Each FP_Column is a list of BlockSlices.
		Each FP_BlockSlice is a list of Lines.  
		Each FP_Line is a list of Runs.  
		
	Finally, each FP_Run contains some fragment of content from the original 
	document, usually text.
