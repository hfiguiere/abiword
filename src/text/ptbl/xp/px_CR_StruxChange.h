// PX_ChangeRecord_StruxChange describes a PXT_ChangeStrux
// made to the document (a formatting change).
// This description should be sufficient to allow undo to
// work and sufficient to allow the formatter to do a
// partial format and screen update (if appropriate).
// The change record must be free of pointers, since it
// represents what was done to the document -- and not
// how it was done (that is, not what was done to various
// intermediate data structures).  this also lets it be
// cached to disk (for autosave and maybe multi-session
// undo).
//
// m_position contains the absolute document position of
// the strux at the time the change was made.
