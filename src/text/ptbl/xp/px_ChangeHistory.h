// px_ChangeHistory implements a history mechanism of PX_ChangeRecords.
// This is used for undo and redo.  We implement a first-order undo/redo.
// (We do not put undo commands into the undo history like emacs.)
// As an editing operation is performed, one or more ChangeRecords will
// be generated.  These are appended to the history.  The undo command
// will take the last ChangeRecord and reverse its effect and decrement
// the undo position.  ChangeRecords which are undone are not deleted
// from the end of the history until a non-redo command is performed
// (and thus invalidating what needs to be redone).  A redo command will
// re-apply the ChangeRecord and advance the undo position.
