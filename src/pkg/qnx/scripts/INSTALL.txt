Here is a quick overview of installing AbiWord with the pkg-installer
and what you have downloaded.

If you have installed patch A then you should be able to
point the package installer (pkg-installer) directly at the 
qpr file that you have downloaded:

  % pkg-installer -u file:///where/your/qpr/file/lives

If you have not installed patch A then you should be able
to extract the files manually into it's own repository:

1) Make a temporary repository directory

  % mkdir /tmp/repository

2) Change to this temporary repository and untar the
   qpr file into it.

  % cd /tmp/repository
  % tar -zxvf /where/your/qpr/file/lives 

3) Start the package installer and point it at this
   repository location.

  % pkg-installer -u file:///tmp/repository

4) You should now see this new repository show up in your
   listing of repositories.  Double click to enter this
   new repository.

5) If all goes well you should be able to select
   Public Software -> Editors -> AbiSuite

   And press install to have it whirr a little, install
   the software and BOOM! You now have AbiWord.
