You must add the ${PREFIX}/AbiSuite/fonts directory to your X server's
font path.  For XFree86, add the line:

FontPath "/usr/local/AbiSuite/fonts/"

in the "Files" section of your /etc/XF86Config file.
If you use a different X server, please see its documentation on how to do
this.

Then re-start your X server.
