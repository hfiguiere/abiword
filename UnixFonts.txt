1. Introduction
---------------
AbiWord limits the fonts it makes available to the user to those
located in /usr/local/AbiSuite/fonts directory (unless you chose
different installation location) and in the locale-specific sub-
directories of this directory (see the UnixLocale.txt document).
A standard set of fonts is provided with AbiWord and these are
located in this directory. If you wish to make an additional font
available to AbiWord, you need to do the following:

(1) Place the font into the fonts directory (or symlink it there,
    if it is locate elsewhere on your machine).

(2) Update the fonts.dir file. 

(3) If you are installing a pfa or pfb font, you will need to provide
    an afm file and place it into the same directory as the font  (no
    afm file is required for ttf fonts - see below).


2. pfa / pfb fonts
------------------
To update the fonts.dir file, you should add an entry for the new
font into fonts.scale and then run mkfontdir. If you do not know
what the entry in the fonts.scale should be, you can generate it
using the utility ttmkfdir. Similarly, if your font did not come
with an afm file, you can generate it from the pfa font using the
utility pfa2afm; the afm file needs to be located in, or symlinked
to, the same directory where you installed the font.

3. TTF fonts
------------
First of all, your font server must support ttf fonts. Then, just
as in the case of pfa fonts, you need to add an entry into 
fonts.scale, and you should use the same programme (ttmkfdir) to
generate the entry from the font itself. Note, that in the case of
ttf fonts, the utility will generate multiple entries, for a number
of diferent encodings the font supports, just disregard those you 
do not need. Once fonts.scale is updated, run mkfontdir.

Printing with ttf is currently supported only using Ghostscript, 
and any ttf fonts that you wish to use have to be registered with
Ghostscript.

IMPORTANT: if you decide to update a ttf font that you have used
with AbiWord previously, you will need to remove some support files
that AbiWord generated. If your font is called myfont.ttf, look for
files myfont.afm and myfont.u2g and delete them.


4. Unicode peculiarities
------------------------
If are using a UTF-8 locale, you need to install unicode fonts. To
make XFree86 to treat a font as a Unicode font, you need to specify
the encoding in the XLFD (the entry in the fonts.dir/fonts.scale file) 
as iso10646-1. To see if your font is treated as a Unicode font run 
`xlsfonts -ll -fn font_name'. This will dump out lot of information
about your font, and somewhere among it should be values min_byte1 
and max_byte1; if both of these are 0, then your font is being treated
as 8-bit only font. In my experience it is not currently possible to 
use a pfa Type 1 or 2 font under XFree86 4.0.2 as a proper Unicode 
font; if you know how to make XFree treat a pfa font as a Unicode font, 
please let me know so that I can update this document.
